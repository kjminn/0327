            <h2>For You - Gavin James</h2>
            <p>Maybe I'll forget, maybe I won't. I'm stuck in the moment, and so far from home. Cause loving nobody, is breaking my heart but you'll never know this, wherever you are. Well maybe I don't give up easily but I know this is hard to see.
                And I wish time would slow down. So I could keep your heart around. If I can't make you stay another day, I'll wait another day for you. For you.
                But I know time won't slow down. So I can't keep your heart in my hand but maybe if you stay a little while. You might feel like I do.

            <h2>Song For You - Rhye</h2>
            <p>
                All my lives I've seen, I'm thankful for this 'Cause you're my favorite place to bleed. you bleed for me. Why don't you tell me what you need? I feel your heart pain, I feel your pain. I feel your heart baby.
                I think you heard me wrong, I hear your eyes. I think it came out wrong, a pillow of lies. Oh, baby please, my words are painful but we're building you and me. Don't cry that way.
                Pain is being lost. It's being me. Losing the ones I love. Pain is watching my mama cry. Just can't stop her tears. It's what I inflict on myself. Pain is how I feel. Can't keep pretending it's gonna be alright.
